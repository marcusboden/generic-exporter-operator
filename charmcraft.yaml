title: Generic Exporter
summary: A generic, configurable exporter charm that sets up an exporter from a snap and exports metrics via relations
description: |
  The Generic Exporter installs an exporter snap and exports metrics and alert rules via relations.

  The charm takes a snap from the store or via resource and installs it. It allows some config options for the snap
  and makes the matrics available via the cos-agent interface.
  The charm also supports configurable alert rules, also exporter by the interface.

  Ideally, the workload that the charm will be monitoring should pack the exporter itself and this charm should not be
  necessary. However, sometimes this is not the case and going through the proper channels to get it implemented
  might not be feasible. This is charm is a workaround for these cases. Essentially, this should only be used if a
  feature request is already reported to the workload charm, but the metrics and rules are needed *now*.
